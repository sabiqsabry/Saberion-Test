# Saberion-Test

This repository contains an assessment task given to me by Saberion.

To preview the site, simply click open the `main.html` file. Please note that this is not a comprehensive showcase of my abilities. Currently, I'm more focused on App Development and ML rather than Web Dev, but I'm still committed to delivering quality work. 

I spent about 4 hours on this project, despite being sick, so it's still a work in progress. Moving forward, I'll continue working on completing the page.
