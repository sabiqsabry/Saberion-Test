# Saberion-Test

This repository contains an assessment task provided by Saberion. The main purpose is to showcase a website, with the preview available in the `main.html` file.

Please note that this project is not a comprehensive representation of my abilities. Currently, my focus lies more on App Development and Machine Learning rather than Web Development. However, I am committed to improving this project further.

Kindly open the `main.html` file to preview the website. Keep in mind that this is what I could achieve within a limited timeframe of 4 hours, especially considering I was not feeling well during the development process.

Moving forward, I will continue to work on enhancing the complete page. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated. Thank you! 🙏🏽
